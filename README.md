<h1>FAT File System Lab</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab I investigate common file systems utilized by Windows. It includes the following tasks:
- <b>Examining the FAT and NTFS File Systems</b> 
- <b>Using a hex Editor to Explore a FAT Partition</b>
- <b>Verifying and viewing forensic image details</b>
- <b>Analyzing a FAT Partition with Autopsy</b>
<br />


<h2>Software and Utilities Used</h2>
- <b>HxD Hex Editor</b>
<br />
- <b>Autopsy Forensic Browser</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>
- <b>InfoSec Learning Labs</b> 
<br />
- <b>Windows 7 Pro</b> 
<br />
- <b>Kali 2 Linux</b>

Log into Windows <br/>

<br />
<br />
Got to computer, select properties of FAT32 drive and NTFS drive, compare security tab and see that it's missing on the FAT32 drive<br/>

<br />
<br />
Check the quote tab, this is where usage can be restricted for users, see that it's also missing on the FAT32 drive <br/>

<br />
<br />
Use command prompt to convert FAT32 volume to NTFS  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Change the Volume Label on the FAT32 drive to NTFS and verify that the security and quota tabs are now present <br/>

<br />
Analyze boot code of DOS (Disk Operating System) based file structure (FAT32 image) <br/>

<br />
<br />
Analyze the first partition, notice the first bite is 80, meaning is bootable. Move over 4 bytes and notice the value of 0C, this is the partition identifier, meaning it's a FAT32 partition set to LBA (Logical Block Addressing) mode addressing <br/>

<br />
<br />
Analyze the next 3 partitions, notice they are unused since it's all zeros. Notice the last 2 bytes is the MBR (Master Boot Record) signature, which in this case is 55 AA.  <br/>

Log into Kali Linux <br/>

<br />
<br />
Use the command line or leafpad to view the text file with the hash value of a forensic image <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/jbD5hRN.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="view hash file of image"/>
<br />
<br />
Use md5sum on the image to check that the hash value matches the one we previously viewed on the text file <br/>

<br />
<br />
Use sha1sum on the image to check that the hash value matches the one we previously viewed on the text file <br/>

<br />
<br />
Open Autopsy Forensic Browser <br/>

<br />
<br />
Go to link on browser and click new case <br/>

<br />
<br />
Add a host <br/>

<br />
<br />
Add image file<br/>

<br />
<br />
Click analyze<br/>

<br />
<br />
Select file analysis and notice the FAT1 and FAT2 records, as well as the MBR<br/>

<h2>Conclusion </h2>
Working on this lab helped develop my understanding of the FAT and NTFS File Systems, as well as the use of forensic tools and procedures such as using hex editors to analyze / investigate a partition or hard drive and the correct procedure of verifying the integrity of an image file through it's hash value before starting to work on it. I also learned the basics of using a computer forensics platform like Autopsy Forensic Browser.
